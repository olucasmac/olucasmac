### Hi there! 👋🏼

I'm Lucas M.A.C., an SRE/DevOps enthusiast, passionate about open source and share knowledge. I have a strong background in Linux and systems administration.

I enjoy learning about science and electronics. In my free time, I like to tinker with 3D printing and play Bomberman® with my daughter. 😄
