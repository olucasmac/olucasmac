### Hello there! 👋🏼

My name is Lucas M.A.C., and I am an enthusiast in SRE/DevOps with a passion for open source and knowledge sharing. I possess a solid background in Linux and system administration. My interests include learning about science and electronics.

During my leisure time, I enjoy engaging in hardware hacking and playing video games with my daughter.
