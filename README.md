### Hello there! 👋🏼

I'm Lucas M.A.C., and I'm really into SRE/DevOps. I love all things open source and enjoy sharing what I know. I've got a good handle on Linux and system admin stuff. I'm also curious about science and electronics.

In my free time, I like to mess around with hardware hacking and play video games with my daughter.
