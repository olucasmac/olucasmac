### Hello there! 👋🏼

I’m Lucas M.A.C., an SRE/DevOps enthusiast, passionate about open source and sharing knowledge. I have a strong background in Linux and system administration. I enjoy learning about science and electronics.

In my free time, I like to tinker with hardware hacking and play videogame with my daughter.
