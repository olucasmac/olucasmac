### TL;DR

I'm born in the land of Caju√≠na ([Teresina-PI](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresina)), father, husband, digital rights activist, [APISoL](https://github.com/apisol) ex-president, [Teresina Hacker Clube](https://github.com/teresinahc) co-founder, and a geek since childhood.

Currently, I live in [Belo Horizonte-MG](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belo_Horizonte), and work as a DevOps/Site Reliability Engineer on [12min](https://github.com/12min), a platform that selects and summarizes the most important non-fiction books.
