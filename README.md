### TL;DR

Born and raised in the land of Caju√≠na ([Teresina](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresina)), father, husband, digital rights activist, ex-president of [APISoL](https://github.com/apisol), co-founder of [Teresina Hacker Clube](https://github.com/teresinahc), and a geek since childhood.

Currently, I live in [Belo Horizonte](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belo_Horizonte) and work as a DevOps/Site Reliability Engineer at [12min](https://github.com/12min), a startup that summarizes best sellers, in audio and text, that can be read in up to 12 minutes.
